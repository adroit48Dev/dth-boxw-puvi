Design and Architecture:

The solution is designed as a distributed task scheduler using FastAPI and asyncio. The architecture consists of the following components:

1. Task Model: The Task model represents an individual task with attributes such as task ID, priority, dependencies, status and retries.

2. TaskScheduler: The TaskScheduler class handles the scheduling of tasks. It maintains the task status, dependencies, and execution order. 
The scheduler processes tasks asynchronously, considering their priorities and dependencies.

3. FastAPI: FastAPI is used to create the web API endpoints for task scheduling and status retrieval.

Handling Task Dependencies:
To handle task dependencies, the TaskScheduler class builds a dependency graph based on the provided tasks. 
Each task is associated with a list of its dependencies. When processing tasks, the scheduler checks if all dependencies of a task are completed before executing it. 
This ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order, respecting their dependencies.

Task Prioritization:
Tasks are assigned priorities ranging from 1 (highest priority) to 100 (lowest priority). (Priorities can be sent through json format.)

Failure Handling:
The scheduler has a mechanism to handle task failures. If a task fails during execution, it can be retried up to a configurable limit. 
The TaskScheduler class can track the number of retries for each task and take appropriate action until its get completed.

Asyncio and Performance Improvement:
The asyncio library is used to handle asynchronous operations and improve the performance and responsiveness of the API. 
By leveraging asyncio, the TaskScheduler can process tasks concurrently without blocking the execution of other tasks or the API itself. 
Asynchronous processing allows for efficient resource utilization and enables better scalability.

Challenges with Asyncio:
While asyncio provides significant benefits, it also introduces certain challenges. Some common challenges when using asyncio include:

1. Debugging: Debugging asyncio-based code can be more challenging compared to synchronous code. 
Handling exceptions and understanding the flow of execution in an asynchronous context may require additional effort.

2. Resource Sharing: When multiple tasks are executing concurrently, proper management of shared resources becomes crucial. 

However, asyncio in the task scheduler solution improves the performance and responsiveness of the API by allowing concurrent execution of tasks, efficient resource utilization, and better scalability. 
It enables the system to handle a large number of tasks and concurrent requests effectively while maintaining responsiveness and performance.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

As this system is for testing purpose and developed with minimal functionalities. 
It can be enhanced by implementing various features and concepts to increase the performance of the system and reliability.
We can implement available libraries such as APScheduler, fast-api-scheduler, celery and various other tools to achieve Task Scheduling efficiently.
Also we can think of Load-Balancing, Caching, Task Prioritization strategies, Monitoring, Authentication, Security techniques to improve the performance of the system.
